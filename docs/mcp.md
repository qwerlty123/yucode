# MCP

nanocode can connect to [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers and
call their tools through its `MCP` tool. Servers can be **remote** (HTTP) or **local**
(stdio), and nothing about a server reaches the model until you connect it.

## Configuring servers

Each server is an `[mcp.<name>]` block.

### Remote (HTTP)

```toml
[mcp.example]
url = "https://example.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "EXAMPLE_MCP_TOKEN"  # optional: send a bearer token from this env var
# auth = "oauth"                            # optional: use interactive OAuth instead
# auto_connect = true                       # optional: connect at startup (default false)
```

### Local (stdio)

```toml
[mcp.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
# env = { FOO = "bar" }   # optional extra environment variables
# auto_connect = true
```

### Options

| Key | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | remote | Server endpoint (mutually exclusive with `command`) |
| `command`, `args` | local | Program and arguments to launch |
| `env` | local | Extra environment variables for the subprocess |
| `auth = "oauth"` | remote | Authenticate via interactive OAuth |
| `bearer_token_env_var` | remote | Send `Authorization: Bearer <env var>` |
| `env_http_headers` | remote | Map of HTTP header → env var holding its value |
| `auto_connect` | both | Connect at startup instead of on demand (default `false`) |

## Connecting

Servers are **manual by default** — they stay inactive, and cost nothing, until you connect
them. Set `auto_connect = true` for servers you always want. Ways to connect:

- **`/mcp`** — open the interactive manager and toggle a server on or off.

- **`@server`** in a message — connect on demand for that turn.

```
- **`/mcp connect <server> [server ...]`** / **`/mcp disconnect <server>`** — terminal
  fallbacks.
- **`/mcp tools [server]`** — list the tools of connected servers.

Connecting several servers in one command runs them concurrently; interactive OAuth browser
flows are serialized so they do not interfere with each other.

Once a server is connected, nanocode can use its tools like any other. Tools the server marks
read-only run without a prompt; anything that may change state asks for
[confirmation](tools.md#confirmations) first.

### Authentication

- **Bearer token** — set `bearer_token_env_var` (or a custom header via `env_http_headers`).
- **OAuth** — set `auth = "oauth"`. Connecting runs the authorization flow; disconnecting
  clears the saved login.

```{admonition} Trust
:class: warning
Local (stdio) servers run programs on your machine, and remote servers receive whatever the
agent sends them. Only connect servers you trust.
