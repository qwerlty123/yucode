# Interaction

minacode runs as a conversation in your terminal. You type a request, the agent works
through it with [tools](tools.md), and you stay in the loop the whole time — steering,
answering questions, and reviewing changes.

## Follow-ups

You can keep typing while minacode works. A submitted follow-up joins the current task if
another model step begins; otherwise it becomes the next task. A draft still in the editor is
never submitted by interrupting — the first `Ctrl-C` discards it instead.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="Terminal view: minacode is working on a request while two follow-up messages wait below a divider reading 'working, 2 queued'."><span class="fs-user">• refactor the MCP manager</span><span class="fs-tool">  Read minacode.py</span><span class="fs-tool">  Edit minacode.py</span><span class="fs-divider">──── working (12s) [ 2 queued ] ─────────────</span><span class="fs-queued">+ also update the tests</span><span class="fs-queued">+ and bump the version</span><span class="fs-prompt">&gt; <span class="fs-caret">▏</span></span><span class="fs-hint">  ↑ recalls queued · Ctrl-C interrupts</span></div>

A `+` below the divider is waiting for the next model step. At that boundary — after the current
tool-call batch, when there is one — all waiting follow-ups are sent together, in order, with the
next model request and move above the divider as normal user messages. They remain retryable
internally until that request completes successfully; a failed request moves them back below the
divider as queued input.

| Key | When | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `Enter` | While the agent works | Queue a follow-up for the next model step |
| `Ctrl-C` | While the agent works | Discard a draft in the editor; with the editor empty, interrupt the task — retracting the message if the agent has not answered yet, or recording the interrupt once it has |
| `Ctrl-C` | Idle prompt | Clear input line |
| `Ctrl-U` | Any prompt | Clear the whole input line, leaving the turn running |
| `Up` / `Ctrl-P` | While working, with an empty editor | Recall the newest queued message |

Interrupting splits two ways. If the agent has not answered yet, `Ctrl-C` *retracts* the
message: it is discarded and never reaches the conversation record or the saved session, as
if it was never sent (your input history still recalls it with `Ctrl-P`). Once the agent has
spoken or run a tool, `Ctrl-C` *interrupts*: the work already shown stays, and the turn is
marked as interrupted so minacode knows it ended early.

## Streaming model output

Model output streams by default in the interactive terminal over OpenAI-compatible Chat
Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages. Text appears as it arrives above the
divider: reasoning, when the model exposes it, uses `thinking`; the answer uses `responding`.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="Terminal view: streamed reasoning appears above a divider labeled thinking, followed by streamed answer text and a divider labeled responding."><span class="fs-dim">  thinking</span><span class="fs-output">    I should inspect the existing implementation first.</span><span class="fs-divider">──── thinking (4s) ─────────────────────</span><span class="fs-dim">  responding</span><span class="fs-output">    I found the issue in the request path.</span><span class="fs-divider">──── responding (7s) ───────────────────</span></div>

The live text is a bounded preview, not a second conversation entry. On completion it clears
and the final answer is rendered once in the normal Rich transcript. Tool-call arguments stay
buffered until the call is complete, so partial JSON never appears as user-facing output. No
streaming setting is required for the usual case; endpoints that reject streaming can disable it
with `provider.stream = false` or `/set provider.stream off`.

## Bash output

While Bash runs, its live output stays above the `working` divider. When the command
is running, a blank row keeps its last live-output line clear of that divider. When the
command finishes, minacode keeps up to three lines from each output stream in the transcript.
The gray `output · Ctrl-O for more` row opens a larger, bounded preview: press `Ctrl-O`
to browse the ten most recent completed Bash previews, newest first. Use `j`/`k` or the arrows
to select one and `Enter` to open it; `Esc` returns to the list, while `Ctrl-O` or `q` closes
the viewer. The complete result remains stored under its `tr.N` key. Each viewer screen leaves
a blank row above its subdued labeled rule, separating it from terminal scrollback.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="A completed Bash command with bounded output, followed by the Ctrl-O list of recent Bash commands and one larger output preview, each separated from scrollback by a labeled rule."><span class="fs-tool">  Bash  pytest -q</span><span class="fs-dim">    ├ output · 14.7s Ctrl-O for more</span><span class="fs-dim">    │ stdout:</span><span class="fs-output">    │   708 passed in 14.84s</span><span class="fs-dim">    └ stored tr.18</span><span> </span><span class="fs-divider">──── Bash outputs · latest 3 ───────────────</span><span class="fs-sel">&gt;  1. tr.18  Bash pytest -q</span><span class="fs-dim">   2. tr.17  Bash git diff --check</span><span class="fs-dim">   3. tr.16  Bash git status --short</span><span> </span><span class="fs-divider">──── Bash output · tr.18 ──────────────────</span><span class="fs-dim">  Bash pytest -q</span><span class="fs-dim"> </span><span class="fs-dim">  stdout:</span><span class="fs-dim">    708 passed in 14.84s</span><span class="fs-dim"> </span><span class="fs-dim">  Esc / ← back · Ctrl-O / q closes</span></div>

## Status bar

A single line beneath the prompt summarizes the runtime. At rest it shows the steady
state: the active provider and model, the reasoning level, context fill and the latest
request's cache hit ratio together as `ctx 23% · cache 98%`, the code index state, and
any background jobs. MCP and skill counts and an update notice appear when relevant.
The cache ratio shows after the first request and refreshes with each response, and
`/status` reports the same figures for the whole session.

While the agent works, the role colors give way to a blue-to-purple sweep that scrolls
across the line, and the live counters join it: a retry or attempt notice, and the
`step N/M` counter once the turn reaches the final fifth of `max_agent_steps`, signaling
that the turn is about to be cut off.

The working divider above the prompt names the current phase — `thinking`, `responding`, or
`web search` while a [provider-side tool](tools.md#provider-side-tools) runs inside the request.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="The status bar in two states. At rest: provider and model, reasoning, context fill with the cache ratio, and index, each in its role color. While working: the same line rendered as a blue-to-purple sweep with a bright band, plus a step counter near the cap."><span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">idle    </span><span class="fs-i sb-base">dashscope/qwen3.7-plus</span><span class="fs-i sb-sep"> | </span><span class="fs-i sb-reason">high</span><span class="fs-i sb-sep"> | </span><span class="fs-i sb-ctx">ctx 23% · cache 98%</span><span class="fs-i sb-sep"> | </span><span class="fs-i sb-index">index ✓</span></span><span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">working </span><span class="fs-i sb-sweep-a">dashscope/qwen3.7-plus | high | </span><span class="fs-i sb-sweep-hi">ctx 41% · cache 95%</span><span class="fs-i sb-sweep-b"> | index ✓ | step 160/200</span></span></div>

## Commands

Type `/` commands at the prompt to inspect state, switch models, manage the
session, or configure runtime behavior on the fly. See the
[command reference](commands.md) for the full list, or run `/help` in a session.

## Mentions

Two inline references, both Tab-completed as you type:

- `@server` or `@server.tool` — connect to an [MCP](mcp.md) server on demand and point the
  agent at that server or tool. <span class="marker">The connection remains active until you
  disconnect it.</span>
- `$skill` — inject a [skill](skills.md)'s full instructions into the current turn.

## Keys and input editing

**Interactive selectors** (model picker, MCP manager, diff viewer) support:

- `j` / `k` or arrow keys to move
- `g` / `G` to jump to top / bottom
- `/` to search, `Enter` to accept, `Esc` to cancel

**The input line** supports:

- history recall and completion
- `Ctrl-C` — clear the current input; with the input empty while running, interrupt the turn (retracting it if the agent has not answered yet)
- `Ctrl-U` — clear the whole input line, in the idle prompt and the follow-up editor alike
- `Ctrl-D` — exit from an empty prompt
- `Ctrl-R` — reverse-search your history
- `Ctrl-O` — browse the ten most recent completed Bash output previews; press it again to close
- `Ctrl-X Ctrl-E` or `Ctrl-G` — edit the current input in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` (falls back to vim)

```

When you open the editor in reply to the agent, its most recent reply is appended below a git-style scissors line, so you can read what you are answering while you compose (the full-screen editor hides that scrollback):

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="External editor view: the draft being composed on top, a git-style scissors line, then the agent's most recent reply below it for reference; everything below the scissors line is stripped before the message is sent."><span class="fs-user">yes, add the reconnect test and cap the backoff at 30s</span><span class="fs-dim">&nbsp;</span><span class="fs-divider"># ------------------------ &gt;8 ------------------------</span><span class="fs-dim"># Reference only: everything below the scissors line is stripped before your</span><span class="fs-dim"># message is sent. The agent's most recent reply follows for reference.</span><span class="fs-dim">&nbsp;</span><span class="fs-prompt">I split McpManager into StdioTransport and HttpTransport, each closing its own</span><span class="fs-prompt">client in close(). Want me to add a test for the reconnect path?</span></div>

Everything from the scissors line down is stripped before the message is sent; a scissors line you type yourself is left untouched. Long replies are capped to their most recent lines.

### Image input

Paste or type the path of an existing local image directly into the prompt. minacode replaces
the path with an inline label such as `[Image #1 · screenshot.png]`, so you can see exactly which
images will be submitted while continuing to edit the surrounding text. Relative paths resolve
from the workspace; quoted paths and backslash-escaped spaces are accepted.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="The input prompt after recognizing a local screenshot path as an editable inline image label."><span class="fs-prompt">&gt; explain <span class="fs-i fs-sel">[Image #1 · screenshot.png]</span> and fix the layout<span class="fs-caret">▏</span></span></div>

PNG, JPEG, WebP, and single-frame GIF files are supported. minacode sends images using the selected
standard API. If the provider explicitly rejects image input, that result is remembered for the
session and later image submissions are blocked without clearing the draft. Queued follow-ups,
resumed sessions, and providers with image input disabled keep readable image labels. See
[`provider.image_input`](configuration.md#optional-provider-settings) to override automatic detection.

## Sessions

<span class="marker">Your work is saved automatically</span> — the conversation, edits, and diffs
are tied to the project directory you started in, so an interrupted session picks up where it
stopped. Sessions untouched for seven days are removed by default, swept in the background when
minacode starts; it reports how many it removed. Resuming a session resets its clock, so one you
keep returning to is never removed. Set `runtime.session_retention_days = 0` to keep them
indefinitely.

Resume from the command line:

```sh
minacode -c              # resume the latest session in this project
minacode --resume        # same, explicit
minacode --resume UID    # resume a specific session by id, from any directory
minacode --resume "fd leak"   # or by name, or by the first few characters of an id
```

Sessions are stored per project, so `-c` and a bare `--resume` never reach into another project's
history — even when your most recent session anywhere was somewhere else. A `UID` is looked up
across every project, so you can resume one by id from wherever you are.

A name or id prefix is searched in the current project first, then everywhere — you can resume a
session by name after moving directories. When a query matches more than one session, minacode
<span class="marker">lists the candidates instead of guessing</span> between them.

Resuming replays the conversation into your scrollback, including the diff each edit made. Long
diffs are trimmed there; `/diff` always has the full text.

### Names

Every session has a name, so you have something to recognize it by later. It starts as the first
line you typed, becomes the agent's current goal once it has one, and stays whatever you set with
`/name`:

```text
/name                 # show the current name and where it came from
/name auth refactor   # set your own; nothing overwrites it afterwards
```

A name is a label, not an identity — sessions may share one, and the id is what makes each unique.
Names are decided once rather than re-read from the conversation, so a session you found under one
name yesterday is still under it today, even after its early messages have been compacted away.

### Switching sessions

`/sessions` — or `/resume`, the same command — lists what is saved, newest first, with how long ago
each was touched and how many rounds it ran. Type to filter across names and opening lines, and
press Enter to re-enter one:

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="The session picker: a searchable list of saved sessions, each showing its name, age, and round count, with the current session marked, above a preview of the highlighted session's id, opening message, and directory."><span class="fs-divider">──── Sessions ─────────────────────────────</span><span class="fs-sel">&gt; port the tool runner to asyncio<span class="fs-i fs-dim">  ·  2h ago · 14 rounds</span></span><span class="fs-dim">  split the large test modules<span class="fs-i fs-dim">  ·  yesterday · 31 rounds</span></span><span class="fs-dim">  fix the fd leak in MCPFileTokenStore<span class="fs-i fs-dim">  ·  3d ago · 1 round</span></span><span class="fs-dim">  what I am doing right now<span class="fs-i fs-dim">  ·  just now · 2 rounds · current</span></span><span> </span><span class="fs-dim">  uid   20260728074943-e22e69e8-070</span><span class="fs-dim">  start port the tool runner to asyncio, starting with Bash</span><span class="fs-dim">  where ~/dev/github/minacode</span><span> </span><span class="fs-hint">  ↑/↓ or j/k move · / search · Enter open · Esc close</span></div>

`/sessions all` widens the list past the current project, adding each session's directory to its
row. Choosing a session ends the current one — it is saved first — and starts the next in its
place, exactly as if you had launched with `--resume`. Choosing the session you are already in, or
pressing `Esc`, changes nothing.

Run it from the prompt between turns. While the agent is working, minacode says so and asks you to
press `Ctrl-C` first: switching sessions mid-turn would abandon a request already in flight.

Sessions saved before names existed list under their id until the next time they are saved.

### Reviewing changes

`/diff` opens an interactive, tabbed viewer with two views:

- **Latest** — what changed during the most recent round of your requests
- **Session** — the net diff for everything since the session began

Navigate with `j`/`k`, `g`/`G`, and `/` search; press `Esc` to close.

### Long sessions

minacode keeps long conversations within a working budget on its own, summarizing older
context as needed so a session can run indefinitely. Run `/compact` to trim it now, or
`/status` to see current context and token usage.
